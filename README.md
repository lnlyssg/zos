# RACF and z/OS tools and info

### Rexxes

[SETRRCVT](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos/blob/master/SETRRCVT.rexx) - Rexx to pull out RACF SETROPTS info from storage without needing to have SPECIAL or AUDITOR. _Any comments or additions gratefully received!_  

[GENPW](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos/blob/master/GENPW.rexx) - Rexx to generate random passwords.  

[REXDES](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos/blob/master/REXDES.rexx) - Rexx to pull out DES hashes from a RACF database. *Unfinished!*  

### Random stuff

[racf.rule](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos/blob/master/racf.rule) - for use with [this](https://racf.guru/2018/04/24/hashcat-commands-for-racf-passwords.html) - based on best64.rule with some minor changes, could do with more tweaking!

[MVS Control Blocks.txt](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos/blob/master/MVS%20Control%20Blocks.txt) - File for use in ISRDDN to make browsing storage easier. Use in conjunction with [this](https://racf.guru/2018/04/25/isrddn-control-block-browsing.html) process.
